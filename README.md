# My very first web page

## Welcome!

This is just a testing 'project' for me to understand the basics of Command Line Interface (CLI), Git and GitHub.
The project has incorporated some images and colors with the use of CSS styling alongside creating the actual content using HTML5.
It displays three different **streams** with each stream containing around six applications and thier corrosponding links. 

The live website for this is located [here](https://atieaa.github.io/My-first-website/)
